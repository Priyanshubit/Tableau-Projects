# Airbnb Tableau Dashboard

## 📌 Project Summary
I created this interactive dashboard in Tableau to determine the most profitable location for starting an Airbnb business based on pricing, number of bedrooms, and occupancy trends.

## 💡 Problem Statement
I wanted to analyze Airbnb data to identify the best location to buy a property and list it on Airbnb. The dashboard focuses on optimizing ROI by evaluating zip codes, bedroom counts, pricing trends, and revenue potential.

## 🔍 Key KPIs
- Most Common Bedroom Count
- Highest Revenue Month
- Estimated ROI / Profit Potential
- Most Underserved Area
- Average Length of Stay

This Tableau dashboard analyzes Airbnb listings in Seattle using visual KPIs:
- Top Zipcode by Price
- Avg. Length of Stay
- Price per Bedroom
- Yearly Revenue Trends
- Most Underserved Area (low supply, high avg price)
- Estimated ROI
